# Use of Generative AI in Contributions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This policy has **ZERO TOLERANCE** around anything labeled
> **MUST**. Especially for wilful violation.

Summary position:

> We use AI to help us build the world, but AI will not run the world.

Generative AI agents are allowed in this project, but with some guiding
principles that emphasize transparency and keeping a human in the loop
before submission.

1. **Mandatory Disclosure**: AI Contributions **MUST** be disclosed. The agent
   _MAY_ sign on as a co-contributor or you _MAY_ indicate such in the body of
   the commit, but either way it **MUST** be disclosed. The contribution
   **SHOULD** include information on _that_ the contribution includes AI, the
   _extent_ of AI contribution in the PR (e.g., tests, scaffolding, all of it),
   **and** _which_ AI agent or agents were used (e.g., jules/gemini 3, claud 4,
   etc).
2. **Forbidden Tools**: The following AI tools are forbidden for _any_ use in
   contributions. You **MUST NOT** use them in any way on this project. This
   list may change over time:
   - Grok/xAI
   - Llama/Meta AI
   - Devin/Cognition AI
   - Perplexity AI
   - Stability AI (and in general we won't use any AI generated "art")
3. **Principal Authorship**: A human (_you_) **MUST** be listed as the primary
   author or coauthor.
4. **Accountability**: A human (_you_) are responsible for any contributions put
   under your name, regardless of if they use an AI. You **MUST** ensure that
   the terms and conditions of the generative AI tool do not place any
   contractual restrictions on how the tool’s output can be used that are
   inconsistent with the project’s open source software license or policies.
   - **Anti-Plagiarism**: If an AI generates a known algorithm (e.g., a specific
     R-tree implementation), the contributor is responsible for verifying it
     does not infringe on restrictive patents or licenses incompatible with this
     project. The contributor is also responsible for ensuring that the
     algorithm's origin is accurately cited.
   - **Proper Usage** If others contributions are included in the output from an
     AI tool, you **MUST** ensure that it is compatible with the license
     structure of both the code's origin AND this project's policies.
   - **Dangerous Contributions** You are responsible for what the AI generates:
     if the AI generates harmful code, you need to be able to answer for it with
     something more than blaming "the AI."
5. **Human Validation**: You **MUST** personally review and validate any code
   contributed by an AI agent in your name. This **MUST** be done _BEFORE_
   submitting it for others to review. You **SHOULD** understand all of what
   is being contributed and **MUST** make note of anything you do not understand.
6. **Quality Standards**: AI Agents output is held to extremely strict quality
   standards and the build must pass successfully (humans are also held to this
   standard, but many of the elements have seemed easier for humans than AI
   agents). They **SHOULD** follow the guidance in `AGENTS.md` and
   `.agents/SKILLS.md`.
7. **Isolation of Concerns**:
   - Agent contributions **SHOULD NOT** modify the code quality system unless
     _directly_ requested to do so.
   - Agent contributions **SHOULD NOT** mix code quality changes with functional
     changes.
8. **Branch Naming and Grouping**: Agent contributions **SHOULD** as a best
   effort name their branches as `<agent name>/<branch name>`, e.g.,
   `jules/my-feature-change`. This is an easy one to miss, but check for it the
   best you can.
9. **Security and Privacy**: You **MUST NOT** include credentials,
   non-anonymized production data, or proprietary logic in prompts to AI agents
   for contributions to this project.

## A Note on Using AI in Pipeline Versus Process

Generative AI tooling **MUST NOT** be integrated into the actual pipeline for
this tool. This tool is about facilitating conlang construction through non-AI means.

AI tools may be used to contribute source code, they may never be part of the
core loop of this system.
